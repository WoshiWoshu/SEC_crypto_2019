# SEC_crypto_2019
3rd year project in Python composed of 14 challenges (inspired from cryptopals/Matasano challenge) involving the basic of cryptography implementations and attacks.
Most of the challenges uses hex and base64 and operates on raw bytes rather than on encoded strings.
Python uses the Crypto module + crypto primitive of the AES encryption/decryption in ECB mode.

PREREQUISITES :

    python3, pycrypto v2.6.1 and requests v2.22.0 must be installed.

USAGE :

    ./challengeXX [input.txt].

NOTE:

    You might want to change the Shebang (at the top of the files) to "#!/usr/local/bin/python3" for macos.
